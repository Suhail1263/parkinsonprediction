## Result 
In this work, various prediction models for Parkinson’s disease detection. For this purpose seven machine learning techniques i.e. are used such as adaptive boosting, RNN, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, decision tree, SVM and linear regression. To obtain the desired results, error rates are calculated i.e. AAE and ARE as well as four performance metrics are evaluated. These four metrics are accuracy, sensitivity, ROC, specificity.
