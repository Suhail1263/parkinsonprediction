## Requirements
Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.
